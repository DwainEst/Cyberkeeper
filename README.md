## üß© About This Repo

This repository is my **public collection of work in penetration testing and security research**.  
It includes:
- Detailed engagement write-ups (redacted for safety and confidentiality)
- Recreated vulnerable lab examples for learning and demonstration
- Scripts, notes, and playbooks I use during engagements
- Templates for reports and proof-of-concept (PoC) artifacts

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** All real engagements are redacted to protect client confidentiality. When permitted, I include sanitised screenshots and sample payloads that are safe for public sharing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How I Work ‚Äî Rules of Engagement & Methodology

Although every client and the subsequent engagment is unique. I follow a general but clear, repeatable process throughout every client engagement:

1. **Pre-engagement & Scoping**  
   - Quotation, Service agreement and Confirmation of engagement.
   - Confirm rules of engagement (ROE), targets, scope, exclusions, and legal authorisation.
2. **Testing**
  2.1. **Reconnaissance**  
       - Passive and active information gathering (OSINT, Asset discovery).
  2.2. **Discovery: Vulnerability Identification**  
       - Scanning, fuzzing, and manual exploration.
  2.3. **Exploitation / PoC**  
       - Controlled exploitation, safe PoC creation, no persistence unless authorized.
  2.4. **Post-exploitation & Impact Analysis**  
       - Data exposure analysis, lateral movement (if in scope).
  2.5. **Report Writing**
       - Capturing steps taken along with actionable remediation guidance.
3. **Reporting**  
   - Presenting the actionable remediation guidance with prioritised findings.
4. **Retest (if required/agreed)**

All work adheres to ethical hacking principles and responsible disclosure standards.

## üíº Projects / Write-ups

Each project folder contains a structured write-up, PoCs, and sanitized evidence.

### Example: `projects/2025-07-internal-webapp/`

**Title:** Internal Web App ‚Äî Auth Bypass ‚Üí RCE (sanitized)  
**Scope:** Internal IP range ‚Äî assets A, B (redacted)  
**Summary:** Authentication bypass through predictable session tokens ‚Üí remote code execution via insecure deserialization.  
**Highlights:**
- CVSS: 9.1 (High)
- Safe PoC for access-level verification (sanitized)

**Files:**
- `writeup.md` ‚Äî full, redacted report  
- `pocs/` ‚Äî sanitized proof-of-concept scripts  
- `screenshots/` ‚Äî redacted evidence  

**Path:** [`projects/2025-07-internal-webapp/writeup.md`](projects/2025-07-internal-webapp/writeup.md)
